# Chess Game

## Overview

This is a simple yet engaging chess game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The project is a result of my passion for both chess and programming, and it demonstrates my skills in game development and logic implementation.

## Features

- **Classic Chess Rules:** The game follows the standard rules of chess, allowing players to enjoy the authentic experience.

- **Graphical Interface:** The graphical user interface is built using Pygame, providing an interactive and visually appealing chessboard.

- **Player vs Player:** Play against a friend locally, taking turns to make moves on the chessboard.

- **Move Validation:** The game ensures that players adhere to the legal moves defined by the rules of chess.

- **Check and Checkmate Detection:** The program identifies check and checkmate situations, enhancing the gaming experience.
