We are goin to make a Chess game that two players could potentially play
Things the Game should have
1. A board
1.1 A picture of a board that I can calculate the pixels and then divide into 64 squares +
1.2 +

0,0 W; 0,1 B; 0,2 W; 0,3 B;
1,0 B; 1,1 W; 1,2 B; 1,3 W; 
2,0 W; 2,1 B; 2,2 W; 2,3 B;
3,0 B; 3,1 W; 3,2 B; 3,3 W;

2. Pieces
2.1 Pons
