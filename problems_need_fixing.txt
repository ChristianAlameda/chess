If a piece has no moves, then the user should be able to click on a piece that has moves

If a player picks a piece initially, then they cannot go to another piece of theirs to move

If a piece can see a piece to take, then I want a red circle for that 

If a piece is in the line of sight of a rook, bishop, or queen then that piece cannot move

Calculate how many times a piece has been moved

There is no castling for black or white
    Neither the king nor the rook may have moved from their starting position at any time in the game prior to castling.
    There must be no pieces in between the rook and the king of any color.
    The king must not be in check.
    None of the squares that the king passes through, including the starting and finishing square, may be under attack by any of the 
    opponentâ€™s pieces during the time of castling.
